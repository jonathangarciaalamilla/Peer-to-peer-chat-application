# peer-to-peer-chat-application
A Python-based, peer-to-peer networked chat application utilizing sockets and multithreading for direct, real-time messaging between connected clients.

In addition to the peer-to-peer functionality, it also supports the conventional client-server based chat architecture.
# installations
This application requires a Python 3.10.7 runtime environment to execute.


# The repository consists of two modes:

- Client-Server: In this mode, the chat server listens for connections from clients and allows them to chat with each other in real-time.
- Peer-to-Peer: In this mode, clients can connect directly to each other and chat in real-time.
